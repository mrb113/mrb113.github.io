title: Developer To CTO Newsletter feature
---
The folks behind the awesome Developer to CTO newsletter deigned me worthy of an interview. In their own words, "Developer to CTO is a weekly newsletter that provides career advice to software developers. We conduct interviews with senior technical leaders for our readers to gain insight into their career paths."

I do not think "senior technical leader" are the right set of words to describe me (yet!), but hopefully you'll enjoy the read. While you're there, check out the rest of their newsletter - I'm looking forward to seeing where it goes.

Shout-out to my sister Lisa for trying the pork buns at Momofuku with me. I promise that's related.
