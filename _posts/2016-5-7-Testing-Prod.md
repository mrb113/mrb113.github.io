title: Testing in prod, or admitting that my web skills are inadequate.
---
See my tagline up there? I write drivers and low level system components. However, I have a website (which you are browsing right now). This was originally a test post to some RSS changes since I fully admit that I don't really know what I'm doing. Any web developers that read this should rightfully cringe at my horrible "well, this might work... not sure why, but let's try it and see!" methodology.

I might as well own it, so I give you my hilariously cringeworthy commit history.

Yikes. On the plus side, my RSS feed works correctly now and the links all work as I expect them to!
