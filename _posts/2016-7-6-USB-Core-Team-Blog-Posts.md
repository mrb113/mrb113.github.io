title: Moving up in the blog world - Microsoft Windows USB Core Team Blog
---
I have recently enjoyed the opportunity to write some blog posts as part my job (which, if you're new here, is a software engineer at Microsoft for the Buses team, most lately working on USB Type-C). Since I view this personal blog as a way to share my technical writing, I'll post links to them here and update the list whenever I write more at work for our [official team blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/usbcoreblog/).

Since the Windows USB Core Team Blog is intended for a different audience than this one, the posts I make there probably aren't very entertaining and (un)fortunately don't contain any of my signature terrible jokes. You'll have to stick around this site if you want any of those.
