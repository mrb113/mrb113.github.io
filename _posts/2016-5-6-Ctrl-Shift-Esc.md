title: Keyboard Shortcuts: Ctrl + Shift + Esc is the new Ctrl + Alt + Del
---
I am going to try out a new series of short & sweet posts in which I share time-saving Windows keyboard shortcuts that I like to use. Sometimes I'll use a keyboard shortcut that I thought was common knowledge, but someone watching will say "How'd you do that?" Today's episode: `Ctrl + Shift + Esc`.

#### Everyone knows Ctrl + Alt + Del, but do you know Ctrl + Shift + Esc?

When I want to kill a program, the first place I go is Task Manager. Most people know to open Task Manager by using `Ctrl + Alt + Delete`. This is so pervasive in pop culture that it even has its own [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-Alt-Delete) - the history is very interesting and I recommend the read. I'll leave searching online for "ctrl alt del jokes" as an exercise to the reader.

In Windows 8, 'Ctrl + Alt + Del` got a makeover and now brings up a menu. From that menu, you may then select Task Manager.

There is still a way to bring up your beloved Task Manager without the extra step. Ready?

```
Ctrl + Shift + Esc
```

Tada. You've saved yourself a few clicks.

#### Open Task Manager directly with Ctrl + Shift + Esc.

The keys even line up nicely on the left side of the keyboard!

Let me know if there's any lesser-known Windows keyboard shortcuts that you can't live without.
