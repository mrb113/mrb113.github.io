This is the landing page for the CWRU [Hacker Society](http://hacsoc.org/) Regex Golf Competition - April 16, 2016.

How to submit your answers: Take a screenshot of each of your solutions, including the point value. Add up the total number of points and include this value in your email. 

Send the screenshots and total points to *mrb113@case.edu* with the subject line 

*Regex Golf: [Your name] [number of points]*

Submissions close one hour after the competition begins.

REMEMBER, you will win points based on a combination of brevity and correctness. There exists a correct regex for all of the problems. If you can't think of a perfect regex, try to come up with one that isn't perfect but will get you some points to keep you in the competition!

(point these to the real links right before the competition starts)

- [Problem 1 - Ring Ring](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff562234(v=vs.85).aspx)

- [Problem 2 - Conjunction Junction](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff562234(v=vs.85).aspx) (really sorry about the blank line that ended up in here as something you need to match)

- [Problem 3 - EECS > Math](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff562234(v=vs.85).aspx)

- [Problem 4 - Version 4](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff562234(v=vs.85).aspx)

Must be present at the end to win a prize or a raffle gift. Raffle and winners will be announced at the end of the hour.
Happy golfing!
