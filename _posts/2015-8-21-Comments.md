title: Comments and post ideas

I might have comments working - this is a test! You need a disqus account, it seems like.

Update on the blog in general: I'd like to go for one post per month.

 I've got an idea that involves the cache manager and wild animals (okay fine also domesticated animals), but I need to take the time to put it all together. 
 I have another idea to do a series on parts of the USB specs, since, well, I do work on USB and read all the specs. I think it might be cool for you guys to learn about how USB works and what this USB Type-C business you've been hearing about is. Specs are dry and I'd love to make it more fun - you never know, Jimbo and Marsha might make a reappearance there. 
 
 If you're reading this... try out that new comments feature. Which would you like to read first?
